do me a favor
I was in awe
I swear by it
rumor has it
fingers crossed
like father, like son
I beg to differ
lets not play the blame game
easier said than done
says who?
I have ... up my sleeves
I'm on it
use your manners
the likes of you
for good measure = just to be on the safe side
for your own good
give sth a try
in one go
while we're at it
is it me, or ...?
I'll live with it
call maintanance
bottleneck
if need be
from scratch
without further ado
when you get to the bottom of it, ...
let's just jump right in
let's dig right in
the question that remains is
that means a lot to me
by and by
long stroy short
chances are
exploded in popularity
if so
be gone
don't get me wrong, but ...
sharing is caring
turn a blind eye
by all means
let's cut to the chase
I'll leave it at that
this one sparks joy
he doesn't break eye contact
The line never goes down!
it's easier on eyes
part ways
let's give that a shot
on the count of three
take ages/forever
with good intentions
.. at will
and that about does it
chip in
laughter is the best medicine
back in line!
we are six days aways from <an event>
all things considered
I'm on it
My house, my rules
I stand corrected
mercy-kill sb
I want what's best for you
when it came to my turn
swear off women
once-in-a-lifetime opprtunity
at best
I've been meaning to ...
catch sb in the act
I can't believe you sided with ...
be that as it may
rules be damned
move it or lose it
get a head count
to err is human
that means a lot to me
step on it
no good can come from ...
get back on your feet
be on the fence
laugh all you want
you deserve what you are getting
no matter what
where there is a will, there is a way
<place> born and raised
out of free will and free mind
leave it to me
you are kind to me VS that's kind of you
sort/kind of = almost
none of your business = mind your ownn business
just like that
from scratch
the clock is ticking
he didn't come because he didn't feel up to it
the point is (that) ...
Likewise
that's disgusting
since when
I can't help but notice
save it
it goes without saying (that)
phone's dead
what's the hurry?
whether you like it or not
speak for sb
sob story
pity!
can't wait to ...
between us,
I got zero sleep last night
what are you talking about?
cut it out
believe it or not
don't take this the wrong way, but ...
enough is enough
present company excluded
much less
I'm not one for <positive thinking>  من اهل « مثبت اندیشی» نیستم
I wasn't born yesterday = I'm not stupid
free as a bird
bad blood between ... and ...
It's a dog-it-dog world out there
knock on wood
truth be told
once and for all
there is no way around it
it means what it means
effective immediately
let the cat out of the bag
a ok
off-topic
me included
take sth seriously
very much so (= yes)
back in the day
I'll look into it
you left me no choice
don't get me wrong, but ...
once upon a time
who does that?
tell me about it
in all seriousness
I wouldnt change/trade it for the world
deep-belly laugh
lost for words
he is on his deathbed
he takes after his mother side
she is a jewel
the apple of my eye
let alone
look at the bright side
don't play innocent with me
you're welcome to come
seeing is believing
all the best
you asked for it
play sculpture
there is no shame in that
with all due respect
bad mouth
my back is killing me
an honest mistake
I owe you an apology/explanation
keep up the good work
at your own risk
it's one of those days
what goes around comes around
pick someone your own size
until further notice
for security reasons
to have the high ground
same here
be warned
your wish is my command
my desk faces the wall
